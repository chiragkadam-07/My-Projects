### Task:
Manager requested a Web App dashboard to monitor call center and agent performance

### Action:
- Developed an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash to monitor call center and agent performance.
- Display KPIs such as total calls answered, abandoned calls, problems resolved, and customer ratings.
- Features agent performance analytics with visualizations for:
  - Daily call trends
  - Average call time
  - Answer speed
  - Satisfaction scores
- Includes filtering options by agent, topic, and date range.
